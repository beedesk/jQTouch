BeeDesk's fork. 
=======

As of Jan 2013, I will stop maintaining this fork. I has become the maintainer of the official jQTouch. 

I would like spend some time porting splitview and other features to the official branch. If you like to see it happens much sooner, please consider making a donation:</p>
