BeeDesk's fork. 
=======

(as of Jan 2013, I will stop maintaining this fork. My effort will focus on the offical fork of senchalabs. I plan to port all features below to the official branch. But, I cannot commit to any timeframe.)

- iPad splitscreen layout,
- Most accurate apple theme,
- iScroll integration,
- Grid layout with badge,
- Radio button (Check group, and toolbar radio) with no js,
- CSS enhancements such as navibar, span-width buttons, buttonset,
- Mail layout css and example,
- Webkit gradient for buttons,
- Working landscape mode with toolbar height auto-shrink,
- etc.
